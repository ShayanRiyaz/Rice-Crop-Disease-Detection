To run the Bing search API first you need to get an API key from the azure website. Refer to the article below on how to do that

Replace ```API_KEY = "ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"``` on line 15 with you api key. </br>
On your command line inside the project directory run:
- ```python bing_search_api.py --query "NAME OF SEARCH" --output OUTPUT_LOCATION```
